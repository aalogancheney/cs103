: (Same answer as for PA4):
  When doing this assignment, I mainly used the book as a reasource and, on
  some occasions, I talked abstractly about the problem with classmates. I did
  not use TA's, office hours, or CP's (not for any other reason than I didn't
  have to -- they're all lovely people).
