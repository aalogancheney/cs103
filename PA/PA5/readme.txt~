NOTE: You can delete the questions, we only need your responses.

: (Same answer as for PA4):
  When doing this assignment, I mainly used the book as a reasource and, on
  some occasions, I talked abstractly about the problem with classmates. I did
  not use TA's, office hours, or CP's (not for any other reason than I didn't
  have to -- they're all lovely people).

================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.

Approximately how long did you spend on this assignment?

: 5-7 hours

Were there any specific problems you encountered? This is especially useful to
know if you turned it in incomplete.

: I had the PA finished, and when I went to submit the assignment I was not 
  aware of the update to the requirements, specifically that the functions
  add_connection() and remove_connection() were supposed to take id numbers
  instead of names. It took some time to rewrite the code, but thankfully not
  too long.

Do you have any other remarks?

: This was a fun assignment. I enjoy the challenge of making a system like this
  work, especially when I account for the things a user might do to break the
  program (such as entering a wrong name, id number, etc.).
