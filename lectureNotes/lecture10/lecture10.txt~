CSCI 103: Lecture 10

Pointer Questions:

int x, y;
int* p = &x;
int* q = &y;
x = 35; y = 46;
p = q;
*p = 78;
cout << x << " " << y << endl;
cout << *p << " " << *q << endl;

What will we see?

- 35 78
- 78 78

- We can do arithmetic on pointers. So we could write something like p + 1, which would give
  us the address of the next integer following the pointer p. C++ will interpret this by
  taking the size of the information stored at p, and add that to the pointer p. Thus, if
  the value at p stores an int, then p + 1 = address of p + 4 bytes. 

Pointer Arithmetic and Array Indexing:

- Array indexing and pointer arithmetic are very much related.
- Array syntax: data[i].
    - This says get the i-th value from the start of the data array.
- When we write the name of an array, we get a pointer to the type of the array. The name of
  an array is a pointer. It follows we should be able to do pointer arithmetic. 
- data[i] is a shortcut for writing *(data + i). Inside the parentheses we are doing pointer
  arithmetic, and the * dereferences the value to give us the value at data[i].

Arrays & Pointers:

- These have a unique relationship.
- Array names evaluate to the start address of the array
    - This means that the name of an integer array has type: int*.
    - The name of character array has type: char*.
- Array indexing is the same as pointer arithmetic. 

Pass by Value vs. Pass by Reference:

- To pass a value by reference, use &value in the argument of a function. In the prototype
  of a function that handles pointers we have to use pointer notation for the formal
  arguments in the function. 

Swap Two Variables:

- This is a classic example. We want to write a function that swaps two variables. 
- Passing by value doesn't work because we are working with copies of the variables. 
- To accomplish this we have to work with references. We use the & operator to pass the 
  address of a variable to a function, and in the function prototype we have to indicate that
  we are working with pointers. 
- To do this with a function, we cannot use pass by value -- it's impossible -- so we have
  to pass by reference. 

Passing Arrays as Arguments:

- When we declare functions that handle arrays we can prototype with a few options:

void add1ToArrayOf10(int []);
void add1ToArray(int *, int);

- Recall that passing the name of an array is like passing a pointer, so in this case we are
  passing with a pointer to the value that is stored in the array. 
- We have to also then pass the size of the array because C does not keep track of
  the size of arrays. It will be happy to let us index past the size of the array. 

Pointers to Pointers:

- We can have multiple levels of indirection.
- Using C/C++ pointer terminology, we can do things like:

  **int

  which is easier to think about if we write *(*int), which dereferences a pointer, so we 
  expect a pointer to a pointer to an int. 

Pointers Can Point to Pointers Can Point to ...

- This is like a chain of links. 
- Consider the example:

int k, x[3] = {5, 7, 9};    // This gives an integer k and an array of 3 integers x
int *myptr, **ourptr;       // This gives a pointer to an int myptr, and a pointer to a 
                            // pointer to an int outptr
myptr = x;                  // the pointer to int points to the first element of x
ourptr = &myptr;            // outptr is set to the address of myptr, which points to the
                            // address of the first element of the array x
k = *myptr;                 // sets the integer k to the value in myptr, which is 5
k = (**ourptr) + 1;         // sets the integer k to 6
k = *(*outptr + 1);         // sets the integer k to 7
