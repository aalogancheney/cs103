Multidimensional Arrays:

- So far we have thought of arrays as 1-dimensional arrays. But we can use multiple
  dimensions for arrays, such as in:

    int myArray[2][3];

- There is no limit to the number of dimensions we can do with this. It is up to us to
  decide how we want to process the array. 

Multi-File Programs:

- We need a way to split our code into many separate files so that we can partition our 
  code.
- We often are given code libraries from other developers or companies.
- It can also help to put groups of related functions into a file.
- bmplib.h has prototypes for functions to read, write, and show .BMP files as well as
  constant declarations. 
- A header file usually has function prototypes and constant declarations. 

Array Information:

- Recall that the name of an array, when passed to a function, is the address of the 
  first element in the array.
