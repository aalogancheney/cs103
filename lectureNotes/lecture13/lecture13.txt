CSCI 103: Lecture 13 10/8

Text File I/O:

- Use ifstream object/variable for reading a file, which can do anything cin can do
- Use ofstream object/variable for writing a file, which can do anything cout can do
- Must include <fstream> (file stream)
- Use << and >> operators on the stream, but knowing that the operations are going to be
  working on files rather than input from the user on the keyboard. 
- Usually, we want to check and make sure if we are reading/writing information 
  correctly, and we can use the fail() member function to check if it succeeds or fails. 
- Always remember to close a file stream using the close() member function.
